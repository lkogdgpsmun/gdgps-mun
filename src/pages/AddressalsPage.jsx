              History shows us that humanity’s greatest leaps have often come in the wake of its deepest crises. The fall of empires has cleared the way for new systems of governance. Economic collapses have forced innovation that has reshaped societies. From the ashes of destruction, the world has again and again found the will to rebuild stronger, wiser, and more united.

              In our own time, the battlefield is not always marked by trenches and artillery, but by shifting alliances, digital warfare, humanitarian struggles, and the silent erosion of freedoms. The challenges before us — climate displacement, contested sovereignties, and the tug-of-war between national interest and global responsibility — demand not only negotiation but foresight, empathy, and resilience.

              As your Secretary-General, I, Nilesh Mandhyan, welcome you to a conference where debate is not just an exercise, but a simulation of the very processes that shape our shared future. Here, you will be called upon to argue fiercely, listen deeply, and craft solutions that can withstand scrutiny from both history and humanity.
